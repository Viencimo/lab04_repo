        <h1>Problem Domain</h1>
        <p>
          There doesn’t really seem to be an app that’s tailored to schoolwork and questions that might
          stem from said school. Why isn’t there an app that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>acts as an agenda of sorts to keep track of work</li>
          <li>
            allows the user to get help with questions from the comfort of their home
          </li>
          <li>
            allows users to subscribe to a school ‘hub’ of sorts, where students post questions and get
            answers from their peers or tutors?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In addition</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No other apps seem to group together questions and answers by schools or districts
          </li>
          <li>
            No other apps seem to combine school features with an agenda for convenience
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s quite the chance here!
          </li>
        </ul>
